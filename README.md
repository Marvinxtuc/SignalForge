# SignalForge

Status: Phase 1 Data Model validated

SignalForge is a local-first VOC Radar MVP. The MVP goal is to prove that the system can surface high-value, actionable user demand signals, not to maximize collection volume or platform coverage.

## Current Phase

This repository is currently in Phase 1: Data Model, validated locally through Docker container-mode migration, seed, and data checks.

Phase 0 Infrastructure is recorded as PASS. Phase 1 is limited to data model work: models, migrations, demo seed, and data validation.

Not included in this phase:

- Connector implementation
- Processing Pipeline
- UI pages
- Business APIs
- Celery task logic

Business APIs start in Phase 2 Backend API.

## Platform Scope

- P0: Reddit and Product Hunt
- P1: X
- P2: Discord

CI must not depend on real platform tokens. Real Reddit and Product Hunt checks are local/manual acceptance items and must be recorded in the final acceptance report later.

## Phase 0 Local Startup

Docker Compose file:

```bash
infra/docker-compose.yml
```

Start services:

```bash
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Check readiness:

```bash
python3 scripts/wait_for_services.py
```

API health:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

Web:

```bash
open http://localhost:3000
```

Stop services:

```bash
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml down
```

Phase 0 validates PostgreSQL and Redis readiness at the socket level, and initializes the PostgreSQL `vector` extension. Business tables and migrations start in Phase 1 Data Model.

## Phase 1 Data Model Commands

Phase 1 local execution uses API container mode so migration, seed, and validation do not depend on host Python packages:

```bash
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d
python3 scripts/wait_for_services.py
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml run --rm api alembic upgrade head
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml run --rm api python /app/scripts/validate_migrations.py
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml run --rm api python /app/scripts/seed_demo_data.py
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml run --rm api python /app/scripts/seed_demo_data.py
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml run --rm api python /app/scripts/validate_data_model.py
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml run --rm api alembic downgrade base
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml down
```

The Phase 1 data flow baseline is:

```text
raw_items -> signals -> clusters -> opportunities
```

`source_url` is the evidence traceability baseline and must be preserved from source evidence through signal review and opportunity evaluation.

## Governance Validation

Run:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_docs.py
python3 scripts/validate_acceptance.py
python3 scripts/validate_no_secrets.py
```

Do not commit `.env` or real API credentials. `.env.example` must contain only variable names and empty values.

## Next Phase

Phase 2 Backend API requires explicit approval. Do not add business API routes in Phase 1; `apps/api/app/main.py` remains limited to `/health`.
